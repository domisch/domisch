      <description>&lt;p&gt;A first step towards global freshwater biodiversity assessments is a comprehensive quantification of the variety of habitat types. We aim to characterize the variety and distribution of global freshwater habitats at a high spatial resolution, to perfrom a regionalization analysis, and to provide environmental correlates of spatial biodiversity patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial freshwater biodiversity patterns</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Global biodiversity is declining rapidly worldwide, and among terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems, freshwaters are particularly vulnerable. These fragmented ecosystems cover less than 1% of the Earthâ€™s surface, yet they harbour approximately 10% of all described species.
Aquatic insects contribute to freshwater diversity by approximately 60% as the largest and most diverse taxa group, and given this substantial proportion, aquatic insects may be considered as a proxy for freshwater biodiversity and ecological state of a given habitat.
We will use latest methods in species distribution modelling and spatial biodiversity science to analyze diversity patterns of this taxa group across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
