Freshwater biodiversity is disproportionately threatened and underprioritized relative to the marine and terrestrial biota, despite supporting a richness of species and ecosystems with their own intrinsic value and providing multiple essential ecosystem services. Future policies and strategies must have a greater focus on the unique ecology of freshwater life and its multiple threats, and now is a critical time to reflect on how this may be achieved. We identify priority topics including environmental flows, water quality, invasive species, integrated water resources management, strategic conservation planning, and emerging technologies for freshwater ecosystem monitoring. We synthesize these topics with decades of first‐hand experience and recent literature into 14 special recommendations for global freshwater biodiversity conservation based on the successes and setbacks of European policy, management, and research. Applying and following these recommendations will inform and enhance the ability of global and European post‐2020 biodiversity agreements to halt and reverse the rapid global decline of freshwater biodiversity.","tags":[],"title":"Safeguarding freshwater life beyond 2020: Recommendations for the new global biodiversity framework from the European experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J\u0026auml;hnig, S.C","Baranov, V.","Altermatt, F.","Cranston, P.","Friedrichs-Manthey, M.","Geist, J.","He, F.","Heino, J.","Hering, D.","H\u0026ouml;lker, F.","Jourdan, J.","Kalinkat, G.","Kiesel, J.","Leese, F.","Maasri, A.","Monaghan, M.T.","Sch\u0026auml;fer, R.B.","Tockner, K.","Tonkin, J.D.","__Domisch, S.__"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610486324,"objectID":"98eb8b4f8f404f967be0af9a073a18aa","permalink":"/publication/pubs/2020-12-01_insect-decline-reply/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubs/2020-12-01_insect-decline-reply/","section":"publication","summary":"A recent global meta‐analysis reported a decrease in terrestrial but increase in freshwater insect abundance and biomass (van Klink et al., Science 368, p. 417). The authors suggested that water quality has been improving, thereby challenging recent reports documenting drastic global declines in freshwater biodiversity. We raise two major concerns with the meta‐analysis and suggest that these account for the discrepancy with the declines reported elsewhere. First, total abundance and biomass alone are poor indicators of the status of freshwater insect assemblages, and the observed differences may well have been driven by the replacement of sensitive species with tolerant ones. Second, many of the datasets poorly represent global trends and reflect responses to local conditions or nonrandom site selection. We conclude that the results of the meta‐analysis should not be considered indicative of an overall improvement in the condition of freshwater ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"Revisiting global trends in freshwater insect biodiversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Near-global freshwater-specific variables at 1km spatial resolution (Domisch et al. 2015).

For SDMs in river ecosystems, species occurrences and predictor data are often aggregated across subcatchments that serve as modeling units. The level of aggregation (i.e., model resolution) influences the statistical relationships between species occurrences and environmental predictors—a phenomenon known as the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP), making model outputs directly contingent on the model resolution. Here, we test how model performance, predictor importance, and the spatial congruence of species predictions depend on the model resolution (i.e., average subcatchment size) of SDMs. We modeled the potential habitat suitability of 50 native fish species in the upper Danube catchment at 10 different model resolutions. Model resolutions were derived using a 90-m digital-elevation model by using the GRASS-GIS module r.watershed. Here, we decreased the average subcatchment size gradually from 632 to 2 km2. We then ran ensemble SDMs based on five algorithms using topographical, climatic, hydrological, and land-use predictors for each species and resolution. Model evaluation scores were consistently high, as sensitivity and True Skill Statistic values ranged from 86.1–93.2 and 0.61–0.73, respectively. The most contributing predictor changed from topography at coarse, to hydrology at fine resolutions. Climate predictors played an intermediate role for all resolutions, while land use was of little importance. Regarding the predicted habitat suitability, we identified a spatial filtering from coarse to intermediate resolutions. The predicted habitat suitability within a coarse resolution was not ported to all smaller, nested subcatchments, but only to a fraction that held the suitable environmental conditions. Across finer resolutions, the mapped predictions were spatially congruent without such filter effect. We show that freshwater SDM predictions can have consistently high evaluation scores while mapped predictions differ significantly and are highly contingent on the underlying subcatchment size. We encourage building freshwater SDMs across multiple catchment sizes, to assess model variability and uncertainties in model outcomes emerging from the MAUP.","tags":[],"title":"From topography to hydrology - the modifiable area unit problem impacts freshwater species distribution models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["He, F.","Wu, N.","Dong, X.","Tang, T.","__Domisch, S.__","Cai, Q.","J\u0026auml;hnig, S.C"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579297444,"objectID":"6a848e6725024e70156fad260e2db673","permalink":"/publication/pubs/2019-05-01_elevation-aspect/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubs/2019-05-01_elevation-aspect/","section":"publication","summary":"Freshwater ecosystems in high-mountain regions are subject to emerging threats such as global warming and expanding human activities. Stream diatoms and macroinvertebrates form an essential component of freshwater ecosystems in high-mountain regions. Although these organisms are sensitive to environmental changes, knowledge regarding their elevational diversity patterns remains limited. Opposite aspects (e.g., north vs south; west vs east) usually receive different amounts of solar radiation and precipitation, leading to distinct in-stream characteristics such as discharge, flow regime, and water temperature. Despite the suggested strong influence of aspect on biodiversity patterns in mountains, its effect on stream diatoms and macroinvertebrates has been largely overlooked. The aims of our study were to 1) investigate whether macroinvertebrate and diatom taxon richness follows the same pattern along an elevational gradient; 2) test the effect of aspect on the elevational diversity (i.e., taxon richness and assemblage dissimilarity) patterns of macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages; and 3) examine the relative importance of elevation, aspect, and the local environment (e.g., in-stream physicochemical variables) in shaping macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages. We investigated macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages in six nearly parallel streams (three streams on the east aspect and three on the west) in the Hengduan Mountains region. We found that the taxon richness of both macroinvertebrates and diatoms showed a monotonic increase with elevation (1623–2905 m a.s.l.) when aspect was not accounted for. When aspect was taken into consideration, macroinvertebrate taxon richness still showed a monotonically increasing elevational pattern on both the east and west aspects, but with significantly different model slopes, while a monotonical pattern for diatoms only remained on the west aspect. In addition, taxon richness of macroinvertebrates may also follow a potential unimodal pattern. The distance-decay relationships followed the same patterns as taxon richness, suggesting that the influence of aspect on diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages was not negligible. Our results suggested that the diversity of both diatoms and macroinvertebrates was jointly determined by elevation, aspect and local environment. Compared to macroinvertebrates, the diatom assemblages were more strongly influenced by the local environment. To gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving elevational patterns of stream biodiversity in high-mountain regions, comparative studies that involve multiple organisms, streams, and mountains across a large elevational range are needed.","tags":[],"title":"Elevation, aspect, and local environment jointly determine diatom and macroinvertebrate diversity in the Hengduan Mountains region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vinuesa, R.","Azizpour, H.","Leite, I.","Balaam, M.","Dignum, V.","__Domisch, S.__","Fell\u0026auml;nder, A.","Langhans, S.D.","Tegmark, M.","Fuso Nerini, F."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579693089,"objectID":"0a42d0ab72bf6861f36e7ded4e9adf3b","permalink":"/publication/pubs/2019-04-01_ai_sdgs/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubs/2019-04-01_ai_sdgs/","section":"publication","summary":"The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and its progressively wider impact on many sectors require an assessment of its effect on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

In this synthesis paper, we discuss how to strengthen the role of ecological modeling in supporting environmental management decisions with a focus on methodological aspects. We address mainly ecological modellers but also potential users of modeling results. Various modeling approaches can be used to predict the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic interventions, including mechanistic models, statistical models, and machine learning approaches. Regardless of the chosen approach, we outline how to better align the modeling to the decision making process, and identify six requirements that we believe are important to increase the usefulness of ecological models for management support, especially if management decisions need to be justified to the public.

Existing GBI designs lacked a systematic method to allocate restoration zones. This study proposes a novel approach for systematically selecting cost-effective areas for restoration on the basis of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and ecosystem condition to give an optimal spatial design of GBI. The approach was tested at a regional scale, in a transboundary setting encompassing the Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean in Andalusia (Spain) – Morocco (IBRM), across three aquatic ecosystems: freshwater, coastal and marine. We applied Marxan with Zones to stakeholder-defined scenarios of GBI in the IBRM. Specifically, we aimed to identify management zones within the GBl that addressed different conservation, restoration and exploitation objectives. Although almost all conservation targets were achieved, our results highlighted that the proportion of conservation features (i.e., biodiversity, ecosystem services) that would be compromised in the GBl, and the proportion of provisioning services that would be lost due to conservation (i.e., incidental representation) are potentially large, indicating that the probability of conflicts between conservation and exploitation goals in the area is high. The implementation of restoration zones improved connectivity across the GBI, and also achieved European and global policy targets. Our approach may help guide future applications of GBI to implement the flexible conservation management that aquatic environments require, considering many areas at different spatial scales, across multiple ecosystems, and in transboundary contexts.","tags":[],"title":"Cost-effective restoration and conservation planning in Green and Blue Infrastructure designs.

Despite the implementation of various environmental regulations, the challenges of safeguarding freshwater assets have so far not been tackled successfully. A promising way forward to stop the loss of freshwater biodiversity and to sustain freshwater‐based ESs is by implementing ecosystem‐based management (EBM), an environmental planning and adaptive management approach that jointly considers social and ecological needs. Responsible for considerable recent success in sustainably managing and conserving marine ecosystems, EBM has not yet been championed for fresh waters. A major reason for the delayed uptake of EBM in fresh waters is likely to be its complexity, requiring planners to be familiar with the latest developments in a range of different research areas. EBM would therefore benefit from becoming more tangible to receive attention on the ground. To facilitate uptake, eight core research areas for EBM and their innovations are introduced, and the way in which they feed into the workflow that guides the EBM planning stage is explained. The workflow links biodiversity distributions with ES supply‐and‐demand modelling and SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely) target planning, including scenario‐ and cross‐realm perspectives, the prioritization of management alternatives, spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation and ES areas, and the quantification of uncertainties. Given the extensive resources, time, and technical capacity required to implement the full workflow, a light and an ultralight version of the workflow are also provided. Applied in concert, the eight well‐known research areas allow for better planning and operationalizing, and eventually for implementing EBM in freshwater ecosystems. EBM has great potential to increase public acceptance by introducing the consideration of human needs and aspirations into typically biodiversity‐driven conservation and management approaches. This will ultimately improve the integrity of freshwater ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"Combining eight research areas to foster the uptake of ecosystem-based management in fresh waters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["__Domisch, S.__","Friedrichs, M.","Hein, H.","Borgwardt, F.","Wetzig, A.","J\u0026auml;hnig, S.C.","Langhans, S.D."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562757377,"objectID":"9a9295ef167eb9c570ce9fec4a55e082","permalink":"/publication/pubs/2019-01-01_spatially_explicit/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubs/2019-01-01_spatially_explicit/","section":"publication","summary":"Aim - Systematic conservation planning is vital for allocating protected areas given the spatial distribution of conservation features, such as species. Due to incomplete species inventories, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for predicting species’ habitat suitability and species’ probability of occurrence. Currently, SDMs mostly ignore spatial dependencies in species and predictor data. Here, we provide a comparative evaluation of how accounting for spatial dependencies, that is, autocorrelation, affects the delineation of optimized protected areas. - Location - Southeast Australia, Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf, Danube River Basin.  - Methods - We employ Bayesian spatially explicit and non‐spatial SDMs for terrestrial, marine and freshwater species, using realm‐specific planning unit shapes (grid, hexagon and subcatchment, respectively). We then apply the software gurobi to optimize conservation plans based on species targets derived from spatial and non‐spatial SDMs (10%–50% each to analyse sensitivity), and compare the delineation of the plans.  - Results - Across realms and irrespective of the planning unit shape, spatially explicit SDMs (a) produce on average more accurate predictions in terms of AUC, TSS, sensitivity and specificity, along with a higher species detection probability. All spatial optimizations meet the species conservation targets. Spatial conservation plans that use predictions from spatially explicit SDMs (b) are spatially substantially different compared to those that use non‐spatial SDM predictions, but (c) encompass a similar amount of planning units. The overlap in the selection of planning units is smallest for conservation plans based on the lowest targets and vice versa. - Main conclusions - Species distribution models are core tools in conservation planning. Not surprisingly, accounting for the spatial characteristics in SDMs has drastic impacts on the delineation of optimized conservation plans. We therefore encourage practitioners to consider spatial dependencies in conservation features to improve the spatial representation of future protected areas.","tags":[],"title":"Spatially explicit species distribution models: A missed opportunity in conservation planning?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Perez Rocha, M.","Bini, L.M.","__Domisch, S.__","Tolonen, K.T.","Jyrk\u0026auml;nkallio-Mikkola, J.","Soininen, J.","Hjort, J.","Heino, J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562757377,"objectID":"e0ba459833f0d4ed407bb6fab2dc8087","permalink":"/publication/pubs/2018-01-01_local_environment/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubs/2018-01-01_local_environment/","section":"publication","summary":"Aim - Understanding variation in biodiversity typically requires consideration of factors operating at different spatial scales. Recently, ecologists and biogeographers have recognized the need of analysing ecological communities in the light of multiple facets including not only species‐level information but also functional and phylogenetic approaches to improve our understanding of the relative contribution of processes shaping biodiversity. Here, our aim was to disentangle the relative importance of environmental variables measured at multiple levels (i.e., local, catchment, climate, and spatial variables) influencing variation in macroinvertebrate beta diversity facets (i.e., species, traits, and phylogeny) and their components (i.e., replacement and abundance difference) in boreal streams. - Taxon - Aquatic macroinvertebrates - Location - Western Finland - Methods - A total of 105 streams were sampled in western Finland, encompassing a geographical extent over 500 km. We analysed variation in the different beta diversity facets and components using distance‐based redundancy analysis and associated variation partitioning procedures. We modelled spatial structures using distance‐based Moran eigenvector maps. - Results - We found that the relative influence of explanatory variables on each diversity facet and component revealed relatively similar patterns. Our main finding was that local environmental and spatial variables generally contributed most to the total explained variability in all facets and components of beta diversity, whereas catchment and climate variables explained less variation in the beta diversity facets at the spatial scale considered in this study. - Main conclusions - Different facets of beta diversity were mainly influenced by local environmental variables and spatial structuring, likely acting through deterministic and stochastic pathways respectively. Identifying the ecological variables and mechanisms that drive variation in beta diversity may be used to guide the conservation and restoration efforts for biodiversity under global change.","tags":[],"title":"Local environment and space drive multiple facets of stream macroinvertebrate beta diversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Effective date: August 02, 2019\nThis site provides information regarding the Privacy Policy and Legal Notes in compliance with § 6 TDG (\u0026ldquo;Telemediengesetz\u0026rdquo;).\nThe Leibniz Junior Research Group (Leibniz Competition grant number J45/2018), also named \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;our\u0026rdquo; in this Privacy Policy, operates the https://glowabio.org website.\nWe want to inform you of our policies regarding the use of personal data when you visit our website and the choices you have associated with that data.

Alternatively, we used empirically derived predictive relationships for species’ response to flow to assess the effect of flow alterations due to climate change in two contrasting central European river catchments. Predictive relationships were set up for 294 individual species based on (1) abundance data from 223 sampling sites in the Kinzig lower‐mountainous catchment and 67 sites in the Treene lowland catchment, and (2) flow conditions at these sites described by five flow metrics quantifying the duration, frequency, magnitude, timing and rate of flow events using present‐day gauging data. Species’ abundances were predicted for three periods: (1) baseline (1998–2017), (2) horizon 2050 (2046–2065) and (3) horizon 2090 (2080–2099) based on these empirical relationships and using high‐resolution modeled discharge data for the present and future climate conditions. We compared the differences in predicted abundances among periods for individual species at each site, where the percent change served as a proxy to assess the potential species responses to flow alterations. Climate change was predicted to most strongly affect the low‐flow conditions, leading to decreased abundances of species up to −42%. Finally combining the response of all species over all metrics indicated increasing overall species assemblage responses in 98% of the studied river reaches in both projected horizons and were significantly larger in the lower‐mountainous Kinzig compared to the lowland Treene catchment.

Ecosystem-based management (EBM) has been proposed as an approach that could more efficiently and adaptively balance ecological and societal needs. However, this raises the question of how social and ecological objectives can be included in an integrated management plan. Here, we present a generic model-coupling framework tailored to address this question for freshwater ecosystems, using three components: biodiversity, ecosystem services (ESS), and a spatial prioritisation that aims to balance the spatial representation of biodiversity and ESS supply and demand. We illustrate this model-coupling approach within the Danube River Basin using the spatially explicit, potential distribution of (i) 85 fish species as a surrogate for biodiversity as modelled using hierarchical Bayesian models, and (ii) four estimated ESS layers produced by the Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) platform (with ESS supply defined as carbon storage and flood regulation, and demand specified as recreation and water use). These are then used for (iii) a joint spatial prioritisation of biodiversity and ESS employing Marxan with Zones, laying out the spatial representation of multiple management zones. Given the transboundary setting of the Danube River Basin, we also run comparative analyses including the country-level purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) and each country's percent cover of the total basin area as potential cost factors, illustrating a scheme for balancing the share of establishing specific zones among countries. We demonstrate how emphasizing various biodiversity or ESS targets in an EBM model-coupling framework can be used to cost-effectively test various spatially explicit management options across a multi-national case study. We further discuss possible limitations, future developments, and requirements for effectively managing a balance between biodiversity and ESS supply and demand in freshwater ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"Social equity shapes zone-selection: Balancing aquatic biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services delivery in the transboundary Danube River Basin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bowler, D.E.","Haase, P.","Hof, C.","Kr\u0026ouml;ncke, I.","Baert, L.","Dekoninck, W.","__Domisch, S.__","Hendrickx, F.","Hickler, T.","Neumann, H.","O'Hara, R.B.","Sell, A.F.","Sonnewald, M.","Stoll, S.","Turkay, M.","van Klink, R.","Schweiger, O.","Vermeulen, R.","B\u0026ouml;hning-Gaese, K."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562757377,"objectID":"0b5dfd691e66b4e08e75fa12da797f93","permalink":"/publication/pubs/2017-01-01_cross-taxa_generalities/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubs/2017-01-01_cross-taxa_generalities/","section":"publication","summary":"Identifying patterns in the effects of temperature on species' population abundances could help develop a general framework for predicting the consequences of climate change across different communities and realms.

Climate and topography have been shown to explain species' distributions at continental scales, but the contribution of natural and anthropogenically altered streamflow is often omitted in large‐scale analyses due to the lack of appropriate data. We test how macroinvertebrate occurrences can be linked to streamflow observations and evaluate the relative importance of streamflow regimes and water use for macroinvertebrate occurrences from 19 orders across Europe. We first paired species sampling locations with hydrological gauging stations considering 5 combinations of the geographic distance and difference in flow accumulation (upstream contributing area). We then used Generalized Linear Models to assess the influence of the streamflow regime, simulated water use, and climate and topography on the occurrence of macroinvertebrates. The pairing method that assigned species records to the closest gauging station in terms of both distance and flow accumulation performed best. Most of the species studied occurred preferentially in river habitats with low mean annual streamflow and streamflow variability, high winter streamflow, and low levels of water withdrawals for irrigation or manufacturing. We conclude that flow accumulation is a useful proxy to evaluate the proximity of species records to gauging stations, omitting species records that do not belong to a given stream reach.

To date, however, such quantitative information about freshwater species distributions remains limited. Major impediments include heterogeneity in available species occurrence data, varying detectability of species in their aquatic environment, scarcity of contiguous freshwater‐specific predictors, and methods that support addressing these issues in a single framework. Here we demonstrate the use of a hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) framework that combines disparate species occurrence information with newly‐developed 1 km freshwater‐specific predictors, to account for imperfect species detection and make fine‐grain (1 km) estimates of distributions in freshwater organisms. The approach integrates a Bernoulli suitability and a Binomial observability process into a hierarchical zero‐inflated Binomial model. The suitability process includes point presence observations, records of site visits, 1 km environmental predictors and expert‐derived species range maps integrated with a distance‐decay function along the within‐stream distance as covariates. The observability process uses repeated observations to estimate a probability of observation given that the species was present. The HBM accounts for the spatial autocorrelation in species habitat suitability projections using an intrinsic Gaussian conditional autoregressive model. We used this framework for three fish species native to different regions and habitats in North America. Model comparison shows that HBMs significantly outperformed non‐spatial GLMs in terms of AUC and TSS scores, and that expert information when appropriately included in the model can provide an important refinement. Such ancillary species information and an integrative, hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework can therefore be used to advance fine‐grain habitat suitability predictions and range size estimates in the freshwater realm. Our approach is extendable in terms of data availability and generality and can be used on other freshwater organisms and regions.","tags":[],"title":"Model-based integration of observed and expert-based information for assessing the geographic and environmental distribution of freshwater species","type":"publication"},{"authors":["__Domisch, S.__","Amatulli, G.","Jetz, W.\t"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562757377,"objectID":"ab0fc6706798b7870449f740c13c293f","permalink":"/publication/pubs/2015-01-01_near-global_freshwater-specific/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubs/2015-01-01_near-global_freshwater-specific/","section":"publication","summary":"The lack of freshwater-specific environmental information at sufficiently fine spatial grain hampers broad-scale analyses in aquatic biology, biogeography, conservation, and ecology.

Beside purely academic aims, model projections are increasingly used for devising conservation and management strategies and they are an established tool in conservation planning. Species distribution models (SDMs) link geographic presence records of species with environmental conditions found at these locations, and extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of species throughout the study area. While the modelling framework is similar in the terrestrial, marine and freshwater realms, each realm comprises specific challenges for combining the spatial scale, the environmental data and the species records for building reliable models. In this paper, we focus on these key issues from a stream ecology perspective and highlight three critical challenges to be kept in mind when building SDMs in stream ecosystems: (1) the spatial configuration in terms of the hierarchical structure of catchments and dendritic stream networks; (2) obtaining relevant and spatially continuous environmental predictors along the stream network, sourcing from three interfaces (stream vs. atmosphere, catchment area, groundwater) and (3) species detectability and thus the challenge of obtaining freshwater species occurrence data along the stream network. To depict freshwater species distributions at the stream level in the best possible way, multi-scale models are recommended, which account for scale dependence, a stronger integration of various environmental data types and sources, and heterogeneous species data. While model projections have the potential to serve as reliable tools for conservation and management purposes, this is only true if these relevant factors are considered in the modelling framework.

However, macroecological studies of climate-change effects on aquatic biodiversity are rare because of a lack of standardized large-scale surveys, e.g., along large latitudinal gradients. Our goal was to assess the overall richness pattern and projected differences in present and future patterns of the stream insect orders Ephemeroptera (E), Plecoptera (P), Trichoptera (T), and combined EPT along an extensive latitudinal gradient across North America (30 to 70°N). We applied Bioclimatic Envelope Models (BEMs) to project present-day and future climatically suitable areas for EPTs on a spatial resolution of 10 arc-min (20 km × 20 km) across North America. To overcome issues related to spatially biased sampling, we assessed climatically suitable areas (CSAs) for each genus and modeled potential generic richness/grid cell, rather than assessing observed generic richness patterns directly. Projected present-day generic richness was greatest between 40 and 48°N latitude, with peaks at 44, 45, and 47°N for the E, P, and T orders, respectively. Our models projected that CSAs would shift an average 4.2 to 5.2°, 4.4 to 5.3° and 3.4 to 4.1°N latitude by 2080 for E, P, and T genera, respectively. Overall, the present-day projected generic EPT richness is highest in the warm and cool temperate zones and shows a unimodal richness pattern that is projected to shift northward under climate-change conditions. A similar northward shift of richness patterns might also apply to other aquatic insects with relatively narrow thermal sensitivity and terrestrial, winged adults, e.g., freshwater Diptera or many aquatic Coleoptera.

This necessitates revisiting site prioritization and species protection for conservation. Patterns of richness and threat of four well-studied aquatic taxa, the fishes, crabs, molluscs and dragonflies largely coincide at the continental scale, at least in Africa. For this study, we focus on dragonflies, for which there is a point locality database, as a surrogate taxon, modeling the species at the fine-scale, using species distribution modeling. With this approach, we built a protected areas network using spatial planning software. Priority areas for dragonfly conservation largely coincided with analyses of global biodiversity hotspots. The Zambian swamps and woodlands, as well as the rainforests of the Lower Guinea and Congo Basin are emphasized as hotspots of dragonfly diversity. Among globally threatened species, 72% were recorded at least once in a protected area. Although the current reserve network covers 10.7% of the landscape, the proportional representation of species geographic distributions in reserves is only 1.2%. The reserve network is therefore inefficient concerning freshwater species, and many areas of conservation priority that are not formally protected remain. The advantage of operating at the fine scale, while covering a large geographic area is that it shifts the focus from the large-scale hotspots to smaller priority areas within and beyond hotspots. Also, by operating at the fine-scale for a large geographical area, the potential exists for local conservation managers to consider campaigning for the inclusion of the priority areas that are not formally protected, while adjacent to the existing reserve networks.

Analyses included assessments of relative changes in species’ climatically suitable areas as well as their potential shifts in latitude and longitude with respect to species’ thermal preferences. Climate‐change effects were also analysed regarding species’ ecological and biological groupings, namely (1) endemicity and (2) rarity within European ecoregions, (3) life cycle, (4) stream zonation preference and (5) current preference. The BEMs projected that suitable climate conditions would persist in Europe in the year 2080 for nearly 99% of the modelled species regardless of the climate scenario. Nevertheless, a decrease in the amount of climatically suitable areas was projected for 57–59% of the species. Depending on the scenario, losses could be of 38–44% on average. The suitable areas for species were projected to shift, on average, 4.7–6.6° north and 3.9–5.4° east. Cold‐adapted species were projected to lose climatically suitable areas, while gains were expected for warm‐adapted species. When projections were analysed for different species groupings, only endemics stood out as a particular group. That is, endemics were projected to lose significantly larger amounts of suitable climatic areas than nonendemic species.

Mean values for variables at the sampling sites were not significantly different from the values at the predicted distribution (Mann–Whitney U‐test P  0.05).

Anticipated increases in temperature and changes in hydrological regimes will have significant adverse impacts on the habitat suitability for many species. This threat will even be higher to endemic and already threatened species due to their restricted distribution and narrow climate tolerance ranges. We investigated the range shifts of a relict Himalayan dragonfly (Epiophlebia laidlawi), a species that is endemic to the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. Currently, the species is only known from few localities in Bhutan, India and Nepal. For conservation of the species, it is necessary to foresee potential suitable habitat areas and range shifts due to global climate change. Here, we first estimated the current potential geographic distribution by identifying the suitable habitat area in the region using bioclimatic envelope models, by means of consensus projections of six algorithms as implemented in the BIOMOD-package in the software program R. We then used the current distribution to render future projections under the A2a and B2a IPCC emission scenarios for the years 2050 and 2080.

Here we show that the use of morphospecies-based assessments of GCC effects will result in underestimations of the true scale of biodiversity loss. Species distribution modelling and assessments of mitochondrial DNA variability in nine montane aquatic insect species in Europe indicate that future range contractions will be accompanied by severe losses of cryptic evolutionary lineages and genetic diversity within these lineages. These losses greatly exceed those at the scale of morphospecies. We also document that the extent of range reduction may be a useful proxy when predicting losses of genetic diversity. Our results demonstrate that intraspecific patterns of genetic diversity should be considered when estimating the effects of climate change on biodiversity.","tags":[],"title":"Cryptic biodiversity loss linked to global climate change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sauer, J.","__Domisch, S.__","Nowak, C.","Haase, P."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1312156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562757377,"objectID":"805e40e903eaab2581895ac40a24acc6","permalink":"/publication/pubs/2011-01-01_low_mountain_ranges/","publishdate":"2011-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubs/2011-01-01_low_mountain_ranges/","section":"publication","summary":"Global climate change (GCC) is expected to lead to massive loss of global biodiversity in the alpine regions of mountain ranges. Studies on the potential effects of GCC on low mountain areas remain sparse, however, despite the high conservation value of these areas as biodiversity refugia. We chose a species distribution modeling approach to assess potential GCC impacts on the future distributions of montane freshwater invertebrates under two different greenhouse gas scenarios and three averaged general circulation models. For this, ensemble models consisting of six algorithms [generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), generalized additive model (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)] were applied to project areas of 23 cold-stenothermic aquatic insects from montane regions of Central Europe. We found an average loss of 70–80% of the potential distribution for the study species until 2080, depending on the underlying Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario. Species distribution ranges below 1000 m above sea level were found to decrease by up to ~96% according to the severest greenhouse gas emission scenario. While the Alps remain the single main refugium under the A2a greenhouse gas emission scenario, the more moderate climate scenario B2a shows fragmented potential persistence of montane insects in some low mountain ranges. The results show that montane freshwater assemblages in low mountain ranges are particularly threatened by ongoing GCC. As vertical dispersal is limited by elevational restriction, low mountain ranges may act as summit traps under GCC. We thus propose that GCC will lead to the extinction of several species and unique genetic lineages of postglacial relict species, resulting in a significant decline in Central European fauna.","tags":[],"title":"Low mountain ranges: summit traps for montane freshwater species under climate change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["__Domisch, S.__","SJ\u0026auml;hnig, S.C.","Haase, P."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1306886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562757377,"objectID":"4203e825c3d5f254dffd5fb82fcef26f","permalink":"/publication/pubs/2011-01-01_climate-change_winne/","publishdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubs/2011-01-01_climate-change_winne/","section":"publication","summary":"Freshwater ecosystems will be profoundly affected by global climate change, especially those in mountainous areas, which are known to be particularly vulnerable to warming temperatures. We modelled impacts of climate change on the distribution ranges of 38 species of benthic stream macroinvertebrates from nine macroinvertebrate orders covering all river zones from the headwaters to large river reaches. Species altitudinal shifts as well as range changes up to the year 2080 were simulated using the A2a and B2a Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate‐warming scenarios. Presence‐only species distribution models were constructed for a stream network in Germany’s lower mountain ranges by means of consensus projections of four algorithms, as implemented in the BIOMOD package in R (GLM, GAM, GBM and ANN). Species were predicted to shift an average of 122 and 83 m up in altitude along the river continuum by the year 2080 under the A2a and B2a climate‐warming scenarios, respectively. No correlation between altitudinal shifts and mean annual air temperature of species’ occurrence could be detected. Depending on the climate‐warming scenario, most or all (97% for A2a and 100% for B2a) of the macroinvertebrate species investigated were predicted to survive under climate change in the study area. Ranges were predicted to contract for species that currently occur in streams with low annual mean air temperatures but expand for species that inhabit rivers where air temperatures are higher. Our models predict that novel climate conditions will reorganise species composition and community structure along the river continuum. Possible effects are discussed, including significant reductions in population size of headwater species, eventually leading to a loss of genetic diversity. A shift in river species composition is likely to enhance the establishment of non‐native macroinvertebrates in the lower reaches of the river continuum.","tags":[],"title":"Climate-change winners and losers: stream macroinvertebrates of a submontane region in Central Europe","type":"publication"}]
