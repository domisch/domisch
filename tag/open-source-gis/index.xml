      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thesis topic: &lt;em&gt;Influence of land-cover on suitable fish habitats in Colombia’s inland waters considering the &amp;ldquo;Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)&amp;rdquo; scenarios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;raquo;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://geo.igb-berlin.de/maps/626/view&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Click here for the visualization&lt;/a&gt; &amp;laquo;&amp;lt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshwater ecosystems are becoming increasingly degraded and freshwater species diversity is declining drastically. Anthropological influences, such as land-cover change, play an important role in these processes. In Latin America, freshwater fish show high rates of diversity and endemism. At the same time, ecosystems in Latin America are threatened by high rates of land-cover change. Therefore, Colombia, endowed with a great habitat diversity and species richness due to a combination of altitude, climate and geographic location, but also distinct land-cover dynamics, was chosen as a case study for this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of the thesis was (i) to consider the land-cover types prevalent, past trends of land-cover change and future land-cover changes projected according to the shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios (SSPs) (ii) to discern the influence of environmental factors, including land-cover, on suitable habitats of Colombian fish species and (iii) to project the possible future development of fish habitats and species richness. The main tools used for these analysis were land-cover modelling (with Dinamica EGO) and species distribution modelling (with BIOMOD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of past land-cover changes shows that factors such as demand or policies contribute to both increases and decreases in agricultural land expansion and deforestation and also that trends are not stable. The land-cover projections are driven by population development, nutrition or technological progress assumptions incorporated in the SSP scenarios and thus represent the trends of &amp;ldquo;Sustainability&amp;rdquo; (SSP1), &amp;ldquo;Middle of the road&amp;rdquo; (SSP2), &amp;ldquo;Regional rivalry&amp;rdquo; (SSP3), &amp;ldquo;Inequality&amp;rdquo; (SSP4) or &amp;ldquo;Fossil-fueled development&amp;rdquo; (SSP5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The projected landcover change for a larger window of Colombia until 2070 following the SSP1 storyline:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across all 1,209 modelled fish species, models suggest that until 2050 and 2070 species richness in the study area will increase and spatial expansion of suitable habitats will occur. Land-cover, unlike climate, had a poor contribution to the projection of changes in habitat development and species richness. As a function of present temperature and precipitation in projected suitable habitats, future habitats of species in presently warmer habitats are projected to have more area, higher elevation on average and lower flow accumulation, than species with lower mean present habitat temperatures. For the Colombian endemic species (n=219) analysed - more likely projected in lower-temperature sub-catchments - the species distribution model projects stagnating future richness, decreasing habitat area, a shift to higher elevated habitats as well as higher extinction rates compared to non-endemic species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migration, expansion or extinction of certain fish species, caused, altered or accelerated by changes in environmental conditions, for example by climate change, are likely to affect the composition, diversity, function, and services of fish communities, further impacting the whole freshwater ecosystem and also structures and systems beyond. Projecting potential future environmental changes and species distributions through models can accordingly help identify factors that may affect species populations or locate places where threats to certain species are particularly high so that appropriate conservation planning steps can be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conservation planning across Colombia</title>
      <link>https://glowabio.org/project/colombia_conservation/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Colombia forms one of the global freshwater biodiversity hotspots, home to 1494 freshwater fish species. This exceptional fish fauna has, however, rarely been considered when selecting areas for biodiversity conservation. This study integrates freshwater fish distributions into a spatial prioritization exercise to assess to which extent (i) freshwater biodiversity, using fish as a proxy, is currently represented within the existing protected areas, and (ii) if alternative protected area networks may have the potential to increase the number of fish species under protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first all available fish data was collated, resulting in a data base of over 112,535 geographic occurrences of 1224 freshwater fishes across Colombia with harmonized nomenclature and revised geo-referenced coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a digital elevation model at 1 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; resolution, the stream network was delineated with a minimum catchment size of 90 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and extracted the corresponding 33,612 sub-catchments that served as spatial units within the analyses. In the next step fish occurrence data and environmental variables (climate, topography, land cover, hydrology) were aggregated across the sub-catchments and an ensemble of species distribution modelling algorithms was employed to project suitable habitat of each fish species across the study area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the principles of systematic conservation planning, integer linear programming was applied to delineate a hypothetical protected area network that fulfills minimum, predefined conservation targets for each fish species, i.e. maximizing species representativeness and connectivity among river catchments, while minimizing the cost of anthropogenic impact, represented by the human footprint index and required area for protection. This spatial prioritization was carried out for four different conservation targets, set to protect 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of each fish species suitable habitats in the priority network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projected suitable habitats of freshwater fish show high species richness in the Amazon and Orinoco basins while endemic and threatened fish mainly are projected for the Magdalena-Cauca and Pacific-Choco region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacking the individual fish predictions gives an estimate of species richness (low: purple, high:yellow), where red points represent the fish sampling occurences:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculated total area of the hypothetical priority area network is between 279,077 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 754,400 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the different conservation targets. It represents 12.1 % – 32.6 % of the study area, needed for the conservation of 20 % - 50 % of 1224 Colombian freshwater fish species. Most sub-catchments are prioritized in the Amazon and Orinoco basins and the least in the Caribbean basins. The priority network extents into the neighboring countries of Colombia, signifying the need of transboundary cooperation in freshwater conservation. Between 9.2 % to 28.2 % of Colombia’s protected areas coincide with the projected priority area network. A sensitivity analysis, locking in the existing protected areas in the spatial prioritization solution, reveals a priority area network 16.3 % to 34.7 % larger than that of the minimum cost priority network. It indicates that the existing protected areas inadequately represent freshwater fish in Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservation efforts are best focused on the Magdalena-Cauca and Pacific-Choco basins for the expansion of protected areas, since the majority of endemic and threatened fish species occurs within those basins. This thesis represents a first important step in the integration of freshwater biodiversity for spatial area prioritization and can serve as a baseline scenario for future conservation planning exercises in Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Potential protected areas for this region are represented in red, here for a target of 20% of the suitable habitat of each 1224 freshwater fish in Colombia, accounting for the lowest human footprint index and sub-catchment size:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Geomorphho90m&lt;/strong&gt; dataset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topographical relief comprises the vertical and horizontal variations of the Earth’s terrain and drives processes in geomorphology, biogeography, climatology, hydrology and ecology. Its characterisation and assessment, through geomorphometry and feature extraction, is fundamental to numerous environmental modelling and simulation analyses. We developed the Geomorpho90m global dataset comprising of different geomorphometric features derived from the MERIT-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) - the best global, high-resolution DEM available. The fully-standardised 26 geomorphometric variables consist of layers that describe the (i) rate of change across the elevation gradient, using first and second derivatives, (ii) ruggedness, and (iii) geomorphological forms. The Geomorpho90m variables are available at 3 (~90 m) and 7.5 arc-second (~250 m) resolutions under the WGS84 geodetic datum, and 100 m spatial resolution under the Equi7 projection. They are useful for modelling applications in fields such as geomorphology, geology, hydrology, ecology and biogeography.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Hydography90m&lt;/strong&gt; dataset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used the MERIT Hydro Digital Elevation Model at 3 arc-sec (∼90 m at the equator) to derive a globally seamless, standardised hydrographic network, the &amp;ldquo;Hydrography90m&amp;rdquo;, with corresponding stream topographic and topologicalinformation. A central feature of the network is the minimal upstream contributing area, i.e. flow accumulation,of 0.05 km2 (or 5 ha) to initiate a stream channel, which allowed us to extract headwater stream channels ingreat detail. By employing a suite of GRASS GIS hydrological modules, we calculated the range-wide upstreamflow accumulation and flow direction to delineate a total of 1.6 million drainage basins, and extracted globallya total of 726 million unique stream segments with their corresponding sub-catchments. In addition, we computed stream topographic variables comprising stream slope, gradient, length, and curvature attributes, as wellas stream topological variables to allow for network routing and various stream order classifications. We validated the spatial accuracy and flow accumulation of Hydrography90m against NHDPlus HR, an independent,national high-resolution hydrographic network dataset of the United States. Our validation shows that the newly developed Hydrography90m has the highest spatial precision, and contains more headwater stream channels compared to three other global hydrographic datasets. This inclusive approach provides a vital, and long-overdue baseline for assessing actual streamflow in headwaters, and opens new research avenues for high-resolution studies of surface water worldwide. Hydrography90m thus offers significant potential to facilitate the assessment offreshwater quantity and quality, inundation risk, biodiversity and conservation, as well as resource managementobjectives in a globally comprehensive and standardised manner. We provide all the computed layers for visualisation and download in 20° × 20° tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
