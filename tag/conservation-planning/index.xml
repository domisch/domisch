      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing Nigeria&amp;rsquo;s Freshwater Biodiversity Hotspots for Conservation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is part of the Guinea Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, which is incredibly endowed with many threatened species. The country also has numerous outstanding freshwater systems in rare and protected areas such as waterfalls and national parks, of which relatively few have been documented for freshwater biodiversity to date. This suggests that the freshwater ecosystems of conservation importance may be grossly underreported in Nigeria. This research hinges on the concept that the loss of some threatened freshwater invertebrates and freshwater ecosystems of high conservation value may be inevitable in Nigeria, unless the actual and potential distributions of such species or sites are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extensive database of all available stream macroinvertebrate species occurrence records from different eco-regions of Nigeria will be prepared. We will employ open-source software such as GRASS-GIS and R to estimate the actual or potential geographical distribution of species across a newly-developed, high-resolution hydrographic network to assess biogeographic patterns of freshwater biodiversity in this unique hotspot. We will also build on the model and use future climate and land cover predictions to obtain an estimate of how species distributions might be impacted by global change. The findings of this research have a very high potential to depict the present and probable future status of Nigeria&amp;rsquo;s freshwater biodiversity and to guide conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conservation planning across Colombia</title>
      <link>https://glowabio.org/project/colombia_conservation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;raquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://geo.igb-berlin.de/maps/290/view&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Click here for the visualization&lt;/a&gt; &amp;laquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia forms one of the global freshwater biodiversity hotspots, home to 1494 freshwater fish species. This exceptional fish fauna has, however, rarely been considered when selecting areas for biodiversity conservation. This study integrates freshwater fish distributions into a spatial prioritization exercise to assess to which extent (i) freshwater biodiversity, using fish as a proxy, is currently represented within the existing protected areas, and (ii) if alternative protected area networks may have the potential to increase the number of fish species under protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first all available fish data was collated, resulting in a data base of over 112,535 geographic occurrences of 1224 freshwater fishes across Colombia with harmonized nomenclature and revised geo-referenced coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a digital elevation model at 1 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; resolution, the stream network was delineated with a minimum catchment size of 90 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and extracted the corresponding 33,612 sub-catchments that served as spatial units within the analyses. In the next step fish occurrence data and environmental variables (climate, topography, land cover, hydrology) were aggregated across the sub-catchments and an ensemble of species distribution modelling algorithms was employed to project suitable habitat of each fish species across the study area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the principles of systematic conservation planning, integer linear programming was applied to delineate a hypothetical protected area network that fulfills minimum, predefined conservation targets for each fish species, i.e. maximizing species representativeness and connectivity among river catchments, while minimizing the cost of anthropogenic impact, represented by the human footprint index and required area for protection. This spatial prioritization was carried out for four different conservation targets, set to protect 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of each fish species suitable habitats in the priority network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projected suitable habitats of freshwater fish show high species richness in the Amazon and Orinoco basins while endemic and threatened fish mainly are projected for the Magdalena-Cauca and Pacific-Choco region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacking the individual fish predictions gives an estimate of species richness (low: purple, high:yellow), where red points represent the fish sampling occurences:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculated total area of the hypothetical priority area network is between 279,077 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 754,400 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the different conservation targets. It represents 12.1 % – 32.6 % of the study area, needed for the conservation of 20 % - 50 % of 1224 Colombian freshwater fish species. Most sub-catchments are prioritized in the Amazon and Orinoco basins and the least in the Caribbean basins. The priority network extents into the neighboring countries of Colombia, signifying the need of transboundary cooperation in freshwater conservation. Between 9.2 % to 28.2 % of Colombia’s protected areas coincide with the projected priority area network. A sensitivity analysis, locking in the existing protected areas in the spatial prioritization solution, reveals a priority area network 16.3 % to 34.7 % larger than that of the minimum cost priority network. It indicates that the existing protected areas inadequately represent freshwater fish in Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservation efforts are best focused on the Magdalena-Cauca and Pacific-Choco basins for the expansion of protected areas, since the majority of endemic and threatened fish species occurs within those basins. This thesis represents a first important step in the integration of freshwater biodiversity for spatial area prioritization and can serve as a baseline scenario for future conservation planning exercises in Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Potential protected areas for this region are represented in red, here for a target of 20% of the suitable habitat of each 1224 freshwater fish in Colombia, accounting for the lowest human footprint index and sub-catchment size:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protected areas in Cuba</title>
      <link>https://glowabio.org/project/cuba_biodiversity/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Freshwater ecosystems are among the most biodiverse and the most important providers of services to humans globally. Unfortunately, these ecosystems are also among the most threatened in the world. In Cuba, the main threats to freshwater ecosystems are climate change and habitat loss and fragmentation induced by land use/land cover change (LULC). Cuba’s National System of Protected Areas (in short SNAP for Sistema Nacional de Áreas Protegidas) is the main tool to protect biodiversity across the country. However, SNAP was not explicitly designed to account for freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem services, river’s connectivity and future scenarios of climate and LULC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the present project is to assess the protection offered by SNAP to freshwater biodiversity and to the provision of freshwater ecosystem services, considering the present conditions and future climate and land use/land cover change scenarios across Cuba. We expect to identify a hypothetical network of protected areas that should assure targets for biodiversity and ecosystem services in the present and future environmental conditions, at the lowest possible cost.&lt;/p&gt;
